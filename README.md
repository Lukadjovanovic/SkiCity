## Installation and Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/make-this-now.git](https://github.com/your-username/make-this-now.git)
    cd make-this-now
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing your project's dependencies, such as `Flask`, `Werkzeug`, etc.)*

4.  **Set up the database:**
    * This project uses an SQL database. You may need to run initial setup scripts or migrations to create the necessary tables and populate initial data.
    * *(Example for SQLite: You might have a `schema.sql` file and a script to initialize it.)*
    ```bash
    # Example: If you have a database initialization script
    python init_db.py
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or a similar address).

## Usage

Once the application is running:

* Navigate to the homepage to view existing recipes.
* Use the navigation bar to go to the "About" page, view "Supplies," or "Add Recipe."
* Click on a recipe card to see its full details and update its rating.
* Utilize the "Add Recipe" form to submit your own recipes, ensuring all required fields are filled and valid.
